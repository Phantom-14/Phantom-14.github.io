abstract: The probabilistic reachability problem, which involves the computation of probabilistic reachable sets, is studied for nondeterministic reach-avoid games. We consider a multiplayer reach-avoid game with an equal number of attackers and defenders moving on a 2D plane with obstacles. Our work provides a first attempt to address such a problem in stochastic environment and has shown some preliminary results.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
