A deterministic and stochastic hybrid dynamics system is essential for dealing with the complex behaviour and stochastic optimal control among multiple agents in a reach-avoid game. Considering the heterogeneous interactions among multiple agents of a complex system, many challenges remain in implementing such a hybrid system.
